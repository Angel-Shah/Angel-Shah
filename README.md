### ðŸ‘‹ Hey!

I'm Angel, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have an interest in all things tech and space related and love to keep updated on latest innovations. I also have a passion for programming and love to work on projects and attend hackathons in my free time.

Currently, I'm searching for internships for my Fall 2021 co-op term.

Please feel free to have a look at some of my projects below.

Current Project I'm working on:
- right now I am working on a smart Voice assistant named "Gideon" (you can find the repo below)


Also, check out my Devpost where you can see many of my projects that have won at hackathons! -> https://devpost.com/AngelShah
